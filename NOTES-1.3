--- (next version) -------------------------------------------------------------
- AutoUV: Added a simple world space normal shader. [dgud]

- The "Scene Info: Area & Volume" command (in the tools menu)
  has been cosmetically improved and now properly displays the info
  in a multiple-column tabular-format, which is much easier to read. [scorpius]

- Added Select|Edge Loop|Select Nth Ring. [optigon]

- Sweep extrusion normal fix. [optigon]

- New Feature: Body|Explode scales objects from a defined center.
  Includes standard and user axes, uniform, and radial axis options.
  (Thanks to ggaliens for the idea) [optigon]

- New Feature: Plane Cut for objects and face regions. [optigon]

- New Feature: Rollup any window by clicking on its titlebar.
  The main Geometry window behaves differently and doesn't rollup.
  Instead, it moves from the foreground to the background, either
  covering or revealing any coexisting windows. [optigon]

- In the Tools menu, Snap Image and Screenshot have been extended
  in several useful ways. It is now possible to take a screenshot of
  just the main viewport. Coupled with this feature are changes to
  Snap Image, which now has options to Fit the image to the viewport's
  dimensions. This new combination of features allows for better
  projection painting workflows using a 2d painting program like Gimp.
  The new Screenshot features are available through in its options
  dialog. You can also save the current view to the Saved Views at
  the same time and with the same name as the screenshot so that they
  can be aligned later. [optigon]

- Plugin Manager format fixes. [optigon]

- AutoUV: Added Move Horizontal and Vertical. [optigon]

- New interface features including:
  - A Menu Toolbar with icons for undo/redo, repeat last command,
  changing selection modes, and opening the Select or Tools
  menus can be switched on via Preferences|User Interface.
  - A new facility for saving and loading preferences from and
  into your current session, has been added to the File menu.
  These new preference subsets are appended with the .pref
  extension, and are saved separately from your 'master' Wings
  preference file. Additionally, both the Save and Load dialogs
  allow you to choose from catagories of preferences you'd like
  to load or save: hotkeys, graphical elements, etc.
  - New icons for the Outliner and Geometry Graph that allow you
  to use custom colors for how they look. These icons can be
  switched on in Preferences|User Interface.
  - Other minor changes include a new color scheme and some minor
  tweaks to the existing gui elements. Switch between the
  Classic Green theme and the new Dark Blue theme in File|Load
  Preferences. [optigon]

- AutoUV: Added Edge|Circularise to AutoUV. [optigon]

- AutoUV: Fix to ensure that Segmentation window opens with
  elements visible in viewport. [optigon]

- Face|Bridge has been extended to connect any two face regions
  regardless of how many faces or vertices they each have. [optigon]

- Added rewrite of Tweak. [optigon]

- I have changed the mouse buttons that perform secondary drag
  operations. For instance, Move|Free has an option to drag in the
  direction of the screen normal, and this option was bound to MMB.
  Now it is activated by holding LMB instead. Simiar changes were
  made to all the other tools that use a single secondary drag
  parameter. Also, introducing Hold LMB into the mix, allowed me to
  make Face|Sweep fully articulated between all four drag parameters
  (Extrude, Angle, Scale, and Rotation). [optigon]

- The arrow key and scroll wheel pan speed preferences have
  been changed to offer a more useful range of adjustment. [optigon]

- Minor changes to Tools|Connect to allow consecutive vertices
  to be placed  on the same edge. [optigon]

- Welding objects with only two faces could crash. (Thanks to
  Fonte Boa). [optigon]

- New Feature: Select|Edge Loop while in vertex mode will now
  convert consecutive vertices to edges. [optigon]

- Select|By|Sharp Edges now allows you to specify Peaks,
  Valleys, or Both. [optigon]

- Saved selection groups have been updated to allow Cycling
  via hotkey, and this feature can be set to cycle only within the
  current selection mode. I also added some selection group delection
  options. One option deletes all saved groups, and the other deletes
  only those groups that are corrupt. [optigon]

--- 1.3.0 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
- New Feature: Rotate|Unconstrained is a trackball style rotation tool
  contributed by ania, complete with magnets, user input rotation points,
  and accessibility from all selection modes. [Anna Celarek]

- Added Conditional Deselection option to improve Smart Highlighting. When
  checked, Deselect only enables Smart Highlighting when there is no selection,
  otherwise the selection is cleared with the selection mode maintained. [optigon]

- Secondary selection Vectors now disregard the Virtual Mirror face, as they should. [optigon]

- The Select|By tools have been extended to search for elements within the
  current selection, or if there is no selection, to search all visible objects.
  In addition, Random now has a user input field. [optigon]

- Fix to restore maximized Wings layout on MS Windows. [optigon]

- Fixed a small StereoLithography export bug. [scorpius]
